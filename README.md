We focus on the post-approval stage, after a drug has been approved by the FDA.\n\t\tOnce a drug is approved, there are still many unanswered questions. For example, how will the drug work for different patient populations? Patients with specific comorbidities? What about patients who failed to respond to other drugs in the same class?\n\t All of this real-world knowledge, data and evidence resides in the minds of healthcare providers. By treating patients, HCPs learn what works and doesn't work, even if a drug wasn't approved for a particular disease.\n\t Today, HCPs share this knowledge with each other through grand rounds, tumor boards, medical conferences and social media. HCPs use social media for many reasons, but a key reason is to share clinical information and treatment paradigms with their colleagues.\n\t We want to incentivize HCPs to share this knowledge on social media. In doing so, we will recognize and compensate for the HCPs that work tirelessly to advance the world's medical knowledge and improve the lives of patients.\n\t Current status\n\t We are building a product to help pharma understand what HCPs are saying about their drugs on social media. Currently, we are in private beta with 11 customers. We will use revenue from this product to incentivize HCPs to share medical knowledge on social media.","whitePaperLink":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4NhdaE37_X8ewy8E_yKUQm6telslyRa/view?usp=sharing","gallery":[{"link":"www.medical.watch","source":"image","mediaUrl":"https://i.imgur.com/Vu95s6l.png"}],"deleted":false,"primaryColor":"#af5dc1","twitterHandle":"MedicalwatchFTW","logo":"https://i.imgur.com/Vu95s6l.png","discordLink":null,"website":"https://my.medical.watch/","tags":["Biopharma","Data Storage","Ecosystems"]}```
